# Fake-Fertilizer-Detector-and-Recommendation-System
This system is a web-based app interface initially envisioned as part of an IoT-enabled project aimed at empowering farmers with data-driven insights into crop and fertilizer management. While the IoT integration remains in development, the current implementation provides users with a simple, intuitive platform to input soil nutrient data (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and receive tailored crop recommendations based on a machine-learning model. It also assesses the risk levels associated with pests and diseases, drawing insights from a linked insect dataset. Additionally, the system includes a fertilizer quality check guideline, equipping farmers with the tools to verify fertilizer authenticity manually. The ultimate goal is to enhance agricultural productivity and decision-making by integrating IoT sensors for real-time data and this interface for actionable insights.
